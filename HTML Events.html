<!-- An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements. -->
